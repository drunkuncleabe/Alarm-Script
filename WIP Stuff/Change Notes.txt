changed top ID to class <div class="navbar navbar-fixed-top navbar-inner">
 
 add brand class to logo
 
 for logo image added background color of white -- style="border-width:0px; background-color:white"
	- probably also should resize the logo (height & width attributes), but wait to see if possible to bring inline with other items.
	
	
	
Edited the default bootstrap.css to get images from code.google.com
